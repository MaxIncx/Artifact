-------------------- ARTIFACT --------------------

Artifact is a Lovecraftian adult text adventure coded in Twine. The game is currently in alpha, and is Early Access.



------------ DESCRIPTION ------------ 

You are a male graduate student studying Archaeology at modern-day Miskatonic University. Being the perfect student, you are on the road to achieve your dreams. All of that begins to change when a mysterious artifact is discovered in ruins outside of Dunwich. Do you have what it takes to transform your school into your own personal harem, avoid suspicion, and bring about a lustful apocalypse?

You must spend your time wisely, as you only have one school year to stealthily turn the entire campus into your sex-crazed bimbo sluts without being caught by a mysterious rival faction. There are branching decision trees, you will need to make calculated and cautious decisions if you are to be successful. You will have to avoid suspicion, as engaging in risky behavior can get you one step closer to being caught. However, with great risk comes great reward!

There are over 14 unique characters, and over 70 possible sex scenes!



------------ INFO ------------

Some of the game's images may be missing (blank, or appearing as a broken image) or unfinished, some formatting may be off, and some game-breaking bugs may be present.

For the demo only, image filesizes have been reduced and may appear slightly pixelated. The full version has the best image quality.



------------ INSTALL ------------

The HTML version opens in a browser, and therefore should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and and Linux. 

The Windows-specific file requires a Windows 64-bit operating system.

Just extract the files using your favorite ZIP extractor (I use 7ZIP) and then double-click the .html or .exe file.
